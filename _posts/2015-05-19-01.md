Hi kymjs,  
  
My name is Adrienne and I am an online-strategist. I stumbled on to your website while doing some research in your industry.  
                                              
Cut a long story short I think I can help your website rank on Search Engines a lot easier. I have compiled a 17 page website audit which lists all the areas that your website needs improvement in.  
  
Would you be interested in this 17 page Website Audit?  
  
I am happy to send it through at no cost of course all I want is the opportunity to call you to see if we can help.  
  
Are you free this week to discuss?  
  
Kind Regards,  
  
Adrienne Bridgeford | Online-Strategist-&-Expert.
